# ApiAuthDemo
 Demo API
 which Authenticate User and create Tokens
 I have tried to use Authentication manually using OWIN 
 this API Project will CRUD Products.
 only authenticated users can perform some operations.
 Valid user Username = admin and Password = admin.
 this is a project for Demo purpose, I have not used any DB. 
instead used static data to persist as long as project is running
